# QuickStart

The core is set as simple as possible, so you should be able to just do plugins very easily.
> Notice: I changed to use bun instead of node, easiest way to migrate is just  `npm i -g bun`
> or `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

1. bun install
2. copy .env.example to .env and configure
3. enable or disable needed plugins at `plugins.json` 
4. bun start
